This project is to practice and understand how to classify any image using the image processing method. The dataset is collected from (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aryashah2k/mango-leaf-disease-dataset).

**About Dataset**

Description
Type of data: 240x320 mango leaf images.
Data format: JPG.
Number of images: 4000 images. Of these, around 1800 are of distinct leaves, and the rest
